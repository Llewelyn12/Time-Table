# Time-Table
This project aims to create a To-Do List program

Add/Edit/Delete Items:
    Allow users to add new tasks to the to-do list.
    Provide the functionality to edit existing tasks.
    Allow users to delete tasks that are completed or no longer relevant.

Specify Time for Each Task:
    Enable users to assign specific times for each task.
    Provide a way to set deadlines or reminders for tasks to enhance time management.

Export to .csv File:
    Implement the ability to save the to-do list as a .csv (Comma-Separated Values) file.
    This feature allows users to export their task data for backup or sharing purposes.
